**Financial Data App**

**Overview**

The Financial Data App is a web application built with React (JavaScript) that fetches financial data from an API and displays it in a table format. The app includes features for displaying, filtering and sorting the data. The information in the table can be filtered by date range, revenue, and net income using the sliders. It can be sorted by clicking the headers (date, revenue and net income) in the table. The website is also mobile-friendly, (the heading and filtering component shift to the next line when the screen size is reduced).
