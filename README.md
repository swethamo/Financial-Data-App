**Financial Data App**

**Overview**

The Financial Data App is a web application built with React (JavaScript) that fetches financial data from an API and displays it in a table format. The app includes features for filtering and sorting the data, and it's designed to be mobile-friendly. You can filter the data by date range, revenue, and net income using the sliders, and sort the data by selecting the header (date, revenue and net income) in the table.
